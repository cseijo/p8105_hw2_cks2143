## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df =
  read_xlsx(
    "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Combine annual precipitation.

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2018     1  0.94 January   
    ##  2  2018     2  4.8  February  
    ##  3  2018     3  2.69 March     
    ##  4  2018     4  4.69 April     
    ##  5  2018     5  9.27 May       
    ##  6  2018     6  4.77 June      
    ##  7  2018     7 10.2  July      
    ##  8  2018     8  6.45 August    
    ##  9  2018     9 10.5  September 
    ## 10  2018    10  2.12 October   
    ## # … with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from Mr. Trashwheel trash collector in
Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trashwheel
collects that trash and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains
information on year, month, and trash collected, including some specific
kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 observations in our final
Mr. Trashwheel dataset. Additional data sheets include month
precipitation data. There are a total of 24 observations in our
precipitation dataset. In 2018, the total amount of precipitation was
70.33 inches. In 2017, the median number of sports balls in a dumpster
was 8.

## Problem 2

Read and clean NYC Transit dataset.

``` r
NYCtransit_df =
  read_csv(
      "./Data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = "TRUE", NO = "FALSE"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset contains information on the NYC transit system entrances,
including station line, name and location, routes served, entrance
types, ticketing available, and ADA compliance. Data cleaning included
renaming variables, specifying the variables (columns) needed for this
dataset, and transforming the entry variable from a character to a
logical variable. The resulting dataset includes 1868 rows and 19
columns. The dataset is somewhat tidy but could use some cleaning up for
the routes.

There are a total of 465 distinct stations.

There are a total of 84 distinct stations that are ADA compliant.

The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending that allow
entrance is 69/183.

Reformat data with route number and route name as distinct variables.

``` r
NYCtransit_tidy = 
  NYCtransit_df %>%
  mutate_at(vars(route8:route11), as.character) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_name",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_number") %>% 
  drop_na(route_number)
```

There are a total of 60 distinct stations that serve the A train.

Of the distinct stations that serve the A train, of 17 are ADA
compliant.
